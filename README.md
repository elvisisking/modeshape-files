# ModeShape Modeler Projects

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Polyglotter/modeshape-modeler/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Polyglotter/modeshape-modeler/latest)

Libraries for managing files and models in an embedded ModeShape workspace. Temporarily here until we find an appropriate home
(like in the ModeShape project).

For more information on ModeShape Modeler, hop into our IRC chat room at irc.freenode.net#polyglotter and talk to our community of contributors and users.

## Building

We use Maven to build our software. The following command compiles all the code, installs the JARs into your local Maven repository, and runs all of the unit tests:

	$ mvn clean install

Running all of the tests may take a while so, alternatively, you can specify `-Dskip.unit.tests=true` to skip all tests:

    $ mvn clean install -Dskip.unit.tests=true
    
Integration tests are long-running and many depend on on-line resources, so they are skipped by default. However, you may still include them by adding `-Dskip.integration.tests=false`:

    $ mvn clean install -Dskip.integration.tests=false
	
This command can then be used to run *just* the integration tests:

	$ mvn verify -Pintegration
